Its launch is scheduled for 2014, and its price should be $1,500. Currently the <em>Google Glass</em> is in the testing phase and already has a fully recorded video with the device.

                <h2>How it works</h2>
                <p>
                    According to sources close to Google, the glasses will have a small screen of LCD or AMOLED at the top and in front of the user's eyes. With the use of a camera and GPS, you can locate yourself, as well as select options with the movement of your head.
                </p>

                <h2>What you can do with Google Glasses</h2>
                <p>
                    Google's publicity video shows that you can turn yourself into a kind of “super-<wbr>human”, since the device can indicate how many meters you are from your destination, if the subway is open or closed, show the weather, calendar and even let you set up appointments with just voice commands.

            <h2>Glass News</h2>
            <p>
                Google has finally revealed the full specifications of Google Glass, and with it a surprise yet unheard of in the market: the search giant will use an audio system based on conduction transduction. Through the rods of glasses, the sound will be transmitted to the user's ear through microvibrations in certain bones of your head, without using any kind of speaker.
            </p>

            <p>
                Beyond the audio surprise, the screen mounted in front of the user's eye also drew attention. Will be 640 x 360 resolution pixels that, in proportion, would be equivalent to a 25-inch high-definition monitor placed 2.5 meters away from the viewer.
